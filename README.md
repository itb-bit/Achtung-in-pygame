# Achtung-in-pygame


This is my version of the game Achtung Die Kurve, also known as Curve Fever. I programmed it in pygame. Achtung is a multiplayer game based on Snake. It lets up to 6 people play on 1 keyboard. Each player only needs 2 keys to control his / her snake. The goal of the game is to make your snake as long as possible. Don't touch your opponents or the walls; you will die. Once in a while there is a randomally break in the snake.
